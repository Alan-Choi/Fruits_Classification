# Fruits_Classification
This Python project classifies fruits by using trained models that were trained using given images of fruits and machine learning
algorithms.

## Overview
- In this project, images of fruits are resized and divided into blocks of 9x9 pixels and the characteristics of the pixels are 
stored as feature vectors
- The feature vectors will be used for statistical analysis and training models
- This project utilizes Scikit-learn to facilitate the demonstration of Lasso Regression and Random Forest techniques as well as
the visualization of confusion matrices

## Packages
- openCV
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## Package Management
- Anaconda

## Dataset
- The images used for this project was downloaded from [_here_](https://www.vicos.si/resources/fids30/)
